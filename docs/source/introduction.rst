Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Network Latency Manager (NLM)** documentation.

NLM is a tool designed to monitor network latency across specified IP addresses, providing real-time feedback through progress bars and latency graphs.

**Features include:**

- **Asynchronous Ping Monitoring**: Efficiently pings multiple IP addresses simultaneously.
- **Real-time ASCII-based Latency Graphs**: Visualizes latency data directly in the terminal.
- **OS-specific Directory Management**: Manages logs, results, and plots in OS-specific directories.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generated from code docstrings for accuracy and consistency.
